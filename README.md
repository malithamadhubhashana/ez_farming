# EZ Farming - Advanced FiveM Farming Script

## Overview
EZ Farming is a comprehensive farming system for FiveM that supports multiple frameworks (ESX, QB-Core, QBX, and Standalone). It features advanced crop management, growth mechanics, weather/season effects, and a complete farming economy.

## Features

### üå± Core Farming System
- **Multiple Crop Types**: Wheat, Corn, Tomato, Potato, Carrot, Lettuce, Strawberry

## Testing Framework Compatibility

A test file `test_framework.lua` is included to help validate framework detection and basic functionality. To enable testing:

1. Add `test_framework.lua` to your client_scripts in fxmanifest.lua
2. Restart the resource
3. Use the `/testfarm` command to run manual tests
4. Check console output for framework detection results

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Database**: MySQL (mysql-async, oxmysql, or ghmattimysql)
- **Inventory**: ox_inventory (recommended), qb-inventory, or esx_inventoryhud
- **Target System**: ox_target (recommended) or qb-target
- **Framework**: ESX, QB-Core, QBX, or Standalone

### Inventory System Support

The script automatically detects and supports multiple inventory systems:

**Priority Order**: ox_inventory ‚Üí qb-inventory ‚Üí framework default

#### ox_inventory (Recommended)
- Full integration with metadata support
- Use items from `ox_inventory_items.lua`
- Best performance and features

#### qb-inventory (QB-Core)
- Native QB-Core inventory support
- Add items from `qb_inventory_items.lua` to your `qb-core/shared/items.lua`
- Compatible with QB-Core framework

#### Framework Default
- ESX: Uses native ESX inventory system
- QB-Core: Uses QB-Core player data items
- QBX: Defaults to ox_inventory (recommended setup)

### Target System Support

**Priority Order**: ox_target ‚Üí qb-target ‚Üí drawtext fallback

- **ox_target**: Modern, optimized target system (recommended)
- **qb-target**: Original QB-Core target system
- **Drawtext**: Fallback system if no target resource is found

### Drawtext System Support

**Priority Order**: ox_lib ‚Üí qb-drawtext ‚Üí native GTA drawtext

When target systems are not available or disabled, the script automatically uses drawtext systems:

#### ox_lib Drawtext
- Modern, customizable text UI
- Rich formatting options
- Position controls and icons

#### qb-drawtext
- Original QB-Core drawtext system
- Simple, reliable text display
- Basic positioning options

#### Native GTA Drawtext
- Built-in GTA drawtext system
- Always available fallback
- Basic 3D world text display

**Configuration:**
```lua
Config.UseTarget = false -- Set to false to use drawtext instead
Config.DrawTextSystem = 'auto' -- 'auto', 'ox_lib', 'qb-drawtext', 'native'
Config.DrawText = {
    enabled = true,
    showControls = true, -- Show [E] key prompts
    position = 'top-center', -- ox_lib position
    font = 0, -- GTA font for native
    scale = 0.35, -- Text scale for native
    color = {255, 255, 255, 255} -- RGBA for native
}
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Download and Extract**
   ```bash
   # Place in your resources folder
   resources/ez_farming/
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - The script will automatically create required tables
   - Supports mysql-async, oxmysql, and ghmattimysql

3. **Add to server.cfg**
   ```cfg
   ensure ox_inventory  # If using ox_inventory
   ensure ox_target     # If using ox_target
   ensure ez_farming
   ```

4. **Configure Framework & Systems**
   ```lua
   -- config.lua
   Config.Framework = 'auto' -- 'esx', 'qb', 'qbx', 'standalone', 'auto'
   Config.UseTarget = true   -- Enable ox_target/qb-target integration
   Config.UseOxInventory = true -- Enable ox_inventory integration
   ```

5. **Add Items to ox_inventory**
   - Copy contents from `ox_inventory_items.lua`
   - Add to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` file
   - Or use the provided items configuration

### ox_inventory Integration
The script includes full ox_inventory support with:
- **Metadata Support**: Items carry quality information, harvest dates, and farmer details
- **Item Stacking**: Proper stacking for seeds and crops
- **Tool Durability**: Farming tools have durability systems
- **Quality Variants**: Different item types for different crop qualities

### ox_target Integration
Enhanced interaction system with ox_target:
- **Farming Zones**: Click-to-interact with farming areas
- **Plant Interactions**: Right-click plants for context menus
- **Shop Integration**: Easy interaction with shop NPCs
- **Dynamic Targets**: Targets automatically appear/disappear based on plant status

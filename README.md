## Testing Framework Compatibility

A test file `test_framework.lua` is included to help validate framework detection and basic functionality. To enable testing:

1. Add `test_framework.lua` to your client_scripts in fxmanifest.lua
2. Restart the resource
3. Use the `/testfarm` command to run manual tests
4. Check console output for framework detection results

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Database**: MySQL (mysql-async, oxmysql, or ghmattimysql)
- **Inventory**: ox_inventory (recommended), qb-inventory, or esx_inventoryhud
- **Target System**: ox_target (recommended) or qb-target
- **Framework**: ESX, QB-Core, QBX, or Standalone

### Setup Steps

1. **Download and Extract**
   ```bash
   # Place in your resources folder
   resources/ez_farming/
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - The script will automatically create required tables
   - Supports mysql-async, oxmysql, and ghmattimysql

3. **Add to server.cfg**
   ```cfg
   ensure ox_inventory  # If using ox_inventory
   ensure ox_target     # If using ox_target
   ensure ez_farming
   ```

4. **Configure Framework & Systems**
   ```lua
   -- config.lua
   Config.Framework = 'auto' -- 'esx', 'qb', 'qbx', 'standalone', 'auto'
   Config.UseTarget = true   -- Enable ox_target/qb-target integration
   Config.UseOxInventory = true -- Enable ox_inventory integration
   ```

5. **Add Items to ox_inventory**
   - Copy contents from `ox_inventory_items.lua`
   - Add to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` file
   - Or use the provided items configuration

### ox_inventory Integration
The script includes full ox_inventory support with:
- **Metadata Support**: Items carry quality information, harvest dates, and farmer details
- **Item Stacking**: Proper stacking for seeds and crops
- **Tool Durability**: Farming tools have durability systems
- **Quality Variants**: Different item types for different crop qualities

### ox_target Integration
Enhanced interaction system with ox_target:
- **Farming Zones**: Click-to-interact with farming areas
- **Plant Interactions**: Right-click plants for context menus
- **Shop Integration**: Easy interaction with shop NPCs
- **Dynamic Targets**: Targets automatically appear/disappear based on plant status

### Configuration Options:
### Basic Settings
```lua
-- Framework and general settings
Config.Framework = 'auto' -- Auto-detect or specify: 'esx', 'qb', 'qbx', 'standalone'
Config.Debug = false
Config.UseTarget = true -- ox_target/qb-target integration
Config.UseOxInventory = true -- ox_inventory integration
Config.MaxDistance = 2.0
```

### Farming Zones
```lua
Config.FarmingZones = {
    {
        name = "Custom Farm",
        coords = vector3(x, y, z),
        size = vector3(50.0, 50.0, 10.0),
        maxPlots = 20,
        allowedCrops = {'wheat', 'corn', 'tomato'},
        blip = {enabled = true, sprite = 140, color = 2}
    }
}
```

### Custom Crops
```lua
Config.Crops = {
    ['custom_crop'] = {
        label = 'Custom Crop',
        seedItem = 'custom_seed',
        harvestItem = 'custom_harvest',
        growthStages = 4,
        growthTime = 300, -- seconds
        waterNeeded = true,
        fertilizerCompatible = true,
